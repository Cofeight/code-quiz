Portfolio HW

This homework assignment covered the continued application of both HTML and CSS. I attempted to deploy flexbox functions so that the page would adjust properly when viewed on desktop, tablet, or mobile device. I also attempted to define the different sections of both the HTML and CSS files to better assist myself and anyone else who would review the code. I know that there are cleaner methods I can use in the future for both meeting the required criteria and reducing extreneous code.
